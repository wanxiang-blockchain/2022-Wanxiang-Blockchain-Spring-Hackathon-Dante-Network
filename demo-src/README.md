# These Demos show how Dante protocol stack works. Some classical situations are as below:

* [**Venachain and Filecoin**](): make the storage service on Filecoin could be accessed from Venachain. 
* [Basic functions](): include general message communication and contracts invocations between multi-chains.
* [**Privacy cross-chain communication**](): one of the special SQoS items make communication between two users on different chains privacy, which likes the SSL/TLS in HTTPS(one of the basic abilities in the web2 internet protocol suite).
* [Omnichain Storage](): make the storage service on Filecoin and Arweave be able to be accessed from other chains in web3 world.
* [Multi-chain Swap](): a simple multi-chain swap dApp example based on hash-lock.
* [Omnichain NFT](): with the help of Dante protocol stack, NFTs minted on Flow could be visited from other chains(like Opensea in this demo).
